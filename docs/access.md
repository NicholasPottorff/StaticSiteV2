# Some accessibility and usability topics that stuck with me  


## Bad Accessibility Kills
We don't often think of how poor accessibility can have negative consequences. During the Color Contrast Deep Dive LavaCon talk, the presenter brought up how poor color choice caused an airplane pilot to press the wrong button resulting in a fatal crash. During my first technical writing class with Dr. Gurak we also discussed how bad organization of information was a contributing factor to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Even something as seemingly harmless as a food recipe could result in getting someone sick if you aren't clear about risks of undercooked eggs for example.


## Headings, headings, headings
Kaufmann's 11 guidelines for headings was probably my favorite page to read in this whole course. To me, these might as well be the 11 commandments from Kaufmann, the benevolent Goddess of Accessibility. It makes my blood boil when people write web content as if they have an ink or paper shortage. Headings help the reader by organizing the information in a way that they are able to pick and choose what they want or need to read. Headings also help me as a writer by providing me an outline and helping me plan out what I'm going to write. Some users might only be interested in certain types of egg dishes, and it is our job as content creators to guide them to their favorite egg dish as fast as we can.

## Make content for everybody
Okay, obviously not everybody, but your content always needs to have concessions to make sure that there are no obstacles that might keep someone from using it properly. More and more games and websites these days have graphical filters for those experiencing color blindness, and adjustable text size for people with dyslexia or poor eyesight. I always try to keep my color palette very minimal, mostly sticking to black and white and one other color. People with trouble distinguishing colors usually don't have trouble with black and white, so this is a pretty safe way to go about color choice.
